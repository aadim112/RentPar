# RentPar

RentPar is a website that helps you find parking location near to your destination. This is useful when you enter such place where finding best parking is difficult. This website helps you find  free as well as paid space to park your vehicle. 

## Working of the RentPar
The site takes your destination co-ordinates and searches for the nearby co-ordinates in the database of the parking space and list those spaces on the site.

User can select the spaces among the listed places and book the space by paying the fee for given amount of time in case if the space registered is free or paid.

For knowing the parking spaces the website has two section:

- List his/her space as a paid or free space to park the vehicle
- Public feedback to locate the public pariking space.

Since the public parking spaces will be free of cost there will be no one to monitor if the place is acquired or not.
While in case of rented parking space the user/ower has to update the allocation of the parking space.
